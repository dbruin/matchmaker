        <p>This application will determine if we are a perfect match or polar opposites. You will be asked to answer 5 questions, to which you will determine on a scale of 1 to 5 how strongly you agree or disagree with each question. Answer 1 if you strongly disagree, 2 if you disagree, 3 if you neither agree nor disagree, 4 if you agree, and 5 if you strongly agree. After the questions, you will be given a score related to how well we matched.</p>
